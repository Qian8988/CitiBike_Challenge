## Overview of the analysis: 

Use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, use the converted datatype to create a set of visualizations to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders; show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week; show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Then, add new visualizations to the final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.


## Results:

## Summary: 

Overall, males were the primary users of Citibikes in New York City during August 2019. The most popular usage hours occurred around 6am till 9am in the morning and between 5 pm and 7 pm in the evening on weekdays and between 10 am and 6 pm on weekends. 

For future analysis, I would suggest looking into data collected from other seasons, to see if the temperatures and weather do any difference to the bike rentals. And secondly, since Thursday is the most popular day of weekdays, I suggest looking into other modes of transportation routes to see how that affects the usage of bike rentals each day of the week.
